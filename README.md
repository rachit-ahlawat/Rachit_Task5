# Rachit_Task5
In this assignment, we performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights through visual and statistical exploration. We started by loading and inspecting the dataset to understand its structure, identifying key features like Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, and others. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we conducted a detailed univariate and bivariate analysis to examine the distribution of individual features and relationships between variables, especially focusing on survival patterns. We also handled missing values and explored correlations among numerical features through heatmaps and pairplots.

## Insights and Findings:
Our analysis revealed several important insights. We observed that females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males, and passengers from the 1st class had better chances of survival than those from 2nd or 3rd classes. Higher fare-paying passengers generally had better survival outcomes, indicating a link between socioeconomic status and survival. Age distribution was skewed towards younger adults, and most passengers embarked from Southampton. The correlation analysis showed that Fare and Pclass had meaningful relationships with survival, while Age had a weaker connection.
